Making the code cleaner for a marketing agency by adding semantic HTML elements, accessible alt attributes, a descriptive title, and more.
# <Code-Refactor-For-Horiseon>

## Description

- I was motiviated by my interest in fixing up old code by replacing old elements with semantic HTML elements and organizing the CSS properties into less selectors.
- Building this project challenged me to renovate the code while keeping the website looking the same as before. It also challenged me to use different CSS selectors based on the changes I made to the HTML and its misuse from before (i.e. many elements were using the same ID selector instead of one class selector).
- The renewal of the code will help the company, Horiseon, by allowing future programmers to understand the code clearly in case they want to make additions.
- I learned how semantic HTML elements are important by noticing that elements like div and container are not as descriptive as nav, main, section, and aside. When using div to describe each part, it is hard to differentiate between different parts in the code because it all looks the same. On the other hand, Semantic elements makes the code easier to read for both screen readers and other programmers because each element is more unique to other elements. Therefore, I also learned that it is good practice to always use semantic HTML elements.
